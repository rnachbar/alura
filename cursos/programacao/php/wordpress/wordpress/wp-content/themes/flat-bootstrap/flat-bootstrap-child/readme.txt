Flat Bootstrap Child WordPress theme is licensed under the GPL.

== HOW TO USE THIS CHILD THEME ==

This theme is a standard WordPress "child theme". It comes with a style.css file that you can edit to override the parent theme's CSS or add new CSS styles to use in your content. It also comes with a functions.php file in case you want to override any theme functions. If you want to make changes to any other files from the parent theme, copy the file down to the child theme directory and edit it there.

By using this child theme to customize Flat Bootstrap, you'll be able to upgrade that theme from WordPress.org to receive bug fixes and new features.

However, once you make changes to this child theme you should NOT update it from WordPress.org or you will lose your changes. To be safe, you may want to make a COPY of this child theme and edit that instead.

You can read more information about how to use child themes on WordPress.org [https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes]
